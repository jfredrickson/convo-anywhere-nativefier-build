# Nativefier build for Convo Anywhere

Unofficial Nativefier build of Convo Anywhere that I use on my personal system.

## Prerequisites

### Pepper Flash

Edit `build.sh` if Pepper Flash is located somewhere other than `/usr/lib/PepperFlash/libpepflashplayer.so`.

## Usage

Run:

```
./build.sh
```

### Optional steps

1. Edit `convo-anywhere.desktop` with the correct path and copy it to a XDG desktop entry directory such as `/usr/share/applications` or `$HOME/.local/share/applications`.
2. Copy `convo-anywhere.png` to an icon directory such as `/usr/share/icons` or `$HOME/.local/share/icons`.
